# Introduction

PHP = "Hypertext Preprocessor" . It is an open-source server side scripting language. ( We can even use python)

Syntax * Php script resides between php tags which allows programmers to embed php scripts within HTML pages *

```
<?php
     echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
?>	
```
It is an interpreted language hence, scripts are parsed at run-time rather than compiled beforehand. 
Source code is not visible to the client. Compatible with most databases.

Requirements : Apache(Web Server), Php and My SQL(Database)

To get system information from PHP
```
<?php phpinfo(); ?> 
```

Adding Comments in PHP is very easy as it supports C++ and Java style comments and also shell style comments

```
// This is C++ or Java style

# Shell style

/* C style comment */
```
